This activity was fun, it consisted of analyzing a conversation and then repeating it with our names, several of my classmates participated and we interacted since we did it several times.

## Second activity

In this part the teacher explained the importance of ***Information questions*** and how we should answer correctly when you do not ask such questions, then we did an activity of completing two conversations using ***verb be***, as in the previous activity some students participated in it.
